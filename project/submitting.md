# Final Project Submissions and Guidelines

1. Create a feature branch "final-project"
2. Have your project code here
3. Do NOT have any passwords or secret info here
    * Instead, if it is necessary to run the project, use a .env file or environment variable and slack me the information when you turn your project in.
4. Have a README.md file that gives me all the instructions I need to run your program
    * If your project can be run by just this code, say so
    * If the project needs additional resources (example: a database) point me to a URL here it is running.  Still include all your code here though.
5. Create a PR to merge this branch with master and include me as a reviewer.
6. For groups with multiple people, each should have their own copy of the code, and each should slack me any needed info (if any) but they can share any demo urls.

## Requirements

* This project should match the proposal you submitted
* This project must show your skills and knowledge
* Follow all the best practices from class
* You CAN use outside libraries, but you will only be judged by your code
* A project may have 1-3 people - bigger teams will be expected to have better results

* Your project must communicate with a web service
    * It can be one you write, or one that is publicly accessible
    * A DB connection does not count
