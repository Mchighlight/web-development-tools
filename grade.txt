A
Your work has bounced between As and Bs, so the project decided where you fell...and it was a very strong project.  Even with the demands of a two-person project, it was met almost every requirement well and was not poor in any of them.  This is an introduction course and there is always more to do (if you and your partner haven't shared the code review, please do) but the primary requirement of the project was to demonstrate the skills from the class and you did so well.
